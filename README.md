### TODO
- ?

### Main
- Start by renting and subletting
- After doing that for a bit unlock taking out a loan and buying a small house
- Increase size of houses you can buy the more experience you have

### Side
- Do renovations on the building (increases sell price and rent price), but costs money (investment) and takes time
- investment system (bank)

### Endgame
- Own the most buildings?

### Speed
- Undetermined
  - 1 week is 1 month IRL (so receiving a month's rent every week)

### Future
- price based on water/park in area and closeness to city centers
- multiplayer
